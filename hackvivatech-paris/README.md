# Hack Vivatech (Paris June 16th, 17th)

## What is it ?

A [25-hours marathon](https://vivatechnology.com/hackathon/) of product development, where diverse ideas collide and the best ones emerge as a new product or service. 

Itâ€™s a madhouse of creative fun, with coding and marketing working together in teams for accelerated productivity. 

Shine in front of tech leaders presenting your project "on stage".

## Cisco Challenge

**Event Experience: Reimagine the Digital Experience of Vivatech Attendees**

Use the intelligence in your wireless network CMX and view location information, dwell times, and analytics to learn how visitors behave.

Cisco Spark SDKs and Cisco Spark Widgets provide the easiest way for developers to embed high quality audio-video calling and messaging into any web or native application.

You can also create Spark Bots to automate routine tasks and inject contextual content into groups, meetings and conversations. Thanks to https://recast.ai/, enhance your bot with natural language processing.

## Cisco Spark Starter Kit

**Cisco Spark trial plan gives you free Chating, Audio & Video calls to other Spark users, and meetings with up to 3 members (Chat, Video, Shared-board), 
everything you will learn during the hackathon about Spark API, you can reuse after.
Moreover, Spark API support is free, 24/24, 7/7, via [email and #spark4devs room](https://developer.ciscospark.com/support.html)**

- Sign up for [Cisco Spark](https://www.ciscospark.com/) and reach to [Cisco Spark Web client](https://web.ciscospark.com/)
- [optional] [Install a Spark client](https://www.ciscospark.com/downloads.html) on your laptop and/or mobile phone, and get instant access from all your devices
- Sign in at [Spark for Developers](https://developer.ciscospark.com) with your Spark account credentials (same as the ones above). This is where you'll get your API access token.

### Cisco Spark Bots

- Do it yourself by [experimenting a Cisco Spark bot](https://github.com/ObjectIsAdvantag/sparkbot-webhook-samples) and [get inspired from several BotKit samples](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/botkit-ciscospark-samples) in nodeJS

OR

- Leverage the [Recast.ai platform](https://recast.ai/docs/create-your-bot) and its Cisco Spark connector.


### Cisco Spark Video

## CMX Starter Kit

### CMX getting started

First of all and before going through a deep dive in the CMX infra made available for the VivaTech Deep Tech Hackathon, I recommend you start with the getting started [on DevNet](https://developer.cisco.com/site/cmx-mobility-services/). 

There is also a [sample code example here with Python & Node.js examples](https://github.com/cbleeker/CMX_Getting_Started_Code).  This repository contains sample code to get started with the Cisco CMX Wireless Location Analytics service in just a few minutes!

It will allow you to:
  - Connect to a Cisco CMX Instance
  - Retrieve the location of a device via mac address
  - Get the details of that device's location including campus, building, and floor information
  - Retrieve an the image and dimensions of the floorplan where the device is located
  - Leverage native image libraries to generate a map showing where a device is currently located
  
Checkout the [repo here](https://github.com/cbleeker/CMX_Getting_Started_Code) to quickly get started with CMX location services.

You also have two webinars recording (in French):
- CMX basics: https://communities.cisco.com/docs/DOC-71123
- Advanced CMX, focus on BLE: https://communities.cisco.com/docs/DOC-70469

Then, you will be able to do the [4 learning labs](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/modules/dna-cmx-mse) which can be completed in an hour. 

In those learning labs, you will go through the [CMX APIs](https://cmxlocationsandbox.cisco.com/apidocs/) and play with a live system using the [DevNet CMX Sandbox](https://cmxlocationsandbox.cisco.com/)

### Meetup session June 6th

We hold a meetup the 6th of June, so you can ckeck the [slides](./docs/20170606-CMX-VivaTech-MeetUp.pdf) and also watch the [recording](https://cisco.webex.com/ciscosales/lsr.php?RCID=2683f6990baf4479a97da959a99a3168) with password JuneGNS2

### CMX resources and VivaTech infra details
The sample code resource [here](https://github.com/cbleeker/CMX_Getting_Started_Code) can be used to quickly get started on the VivaTech CMX infrastucture setup for this hackathon!  Details will be updated here on how to use it.
