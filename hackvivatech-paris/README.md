# Hack Vivatech (Paris June 16th, 17th)

## What is it ?

A 25-hour marathon of product development, where diverse ideas collide and the best ones emerge as a new product or service. 

Itâ€™s a madhouse of creative fun, with coding and marketing working together in teams for accelerated productivity. 

Shine in front of tech leaders presenting your project "on stage".


## Cisco Challenge

**Event Experience: Reimagine the Digital Experience of Vivatech Attendees**

Use the intelligence in your wireless network CMX and view location information, dwell times, and analytics to learn how visitors behave.

Cisco Spark SDKs and Cisco Spark Widgets provide the easiest way for developers to embed high quality audio-video calling and messaging into any web or native application.

You can also create Spark Bots to automate routine tasks and inject contextual content into groups, meetings and conversations. Thanks to https://recast.ai/, enhance your bot with natural language processing.


## Cisco Spark Starter Kit

**Cisco Spark trial plan gives you free Chating, Audio & Video calls to other Spark users, and meetings with up to 3 members (Chat, Video, Shared-board), 
everything you will learn during the hackathon about Spark API, you can reuse after.
Moreover, Spark API support is free, 24/24, 7/7, via [email and #spark4devs room](https://developer.ciscospark.com/support.html)**

- Sign up for [Cisco Spark](https://www.ciscospark.com/) and reach to [Cisco Spark Web client](https://web.ciscospark.com/)
- [optional] [Install a Spark client](https://www.ciscospark.com/downloads.html) on your laptop and/or mobile phone, and get instant access from all your devices
- Sign in at [Spark for Developers] (https://developer.ciscospark.com) with your Spark account credentials (same as the ones above). This is where you'll get your API access token.

- Take the  [Cisco Spark Learning Track](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/tracks/collab-cloud) to learn to automate Cisco Spark and create Cisco Spark Applications (bots, OAUTH integrations).
- Take the [Using Rooms & Messages Learning Lab](https://developer.ciscospark.com/samples-tutorials.html) at DevNet - Cisco Developer Network,
- [optional] import the [Postman collection](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/postman-ciscospark) for CiscoSpark to quickly generate code,

- Check [awesome resources](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/awesome-ciscospark) to get code samples and SDKs in various languages,

- Connect with other bot builders through the [Sparkers'community on devNet](https://developer.cisco.com/site/spark).


### Cisco Spark Bots

- Do it yourself by [experimenting a Cisco Spark bot](https://github.com/ObjectIsAdvantag/sparkbot-webhook-samples) and [get inspired from several BotKit samples](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/botkit-ciscospark-samples) in nodeJS

OR

- Leverage the [Recast.ai platform](https://recast.ai/docs/create-your-bot) and its Cisco Spark connector.
