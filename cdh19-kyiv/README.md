# Cisco DevNet Hackathon 2019 (Kyiv, Ukraine | 23-24 March)

Welcome to the Cisco Technical Resources repo for cdh19-kyiv.
In this repo you'll find developer resources to quickly get started with Cisco technologies and APIs.

Registration and schedule of the hackathon you can find [here](https://www.cisco.com/c/m/uk_ua/training-events/2018/hackathon/index.html)

This workshop requires: 
 - Cisco DevNet account, register [by link](https://developer.cisco.com/join/kyiv0319) 
 - Webex Team account – sign up at [https://www.webex.com/](https://www.webex.com/) Communication through [this Webex space](https://eurl.io/#BJaDYXtPN)  

To access some sandbox/services you will need to use Cisco AnyConnect:
 - For Mac and Windows, you can download [here](https://developer.cisco.com/site/sandbox/anyconnect/)
 - For Linux, install OpenConnect, [see here](https://developer.cisco.com/learning/modules/dev-setup/dev-ubuntu/step/7)
 

_Your final task is to show the prototype of an application/program/script that extends or complements the capabilities of Cisco products and solutions._

You can choose one (main) directions:

  - [Wireless programmability](#цireless-programmability)
  - [Networking](#networking)
  - [Security](#security)
  - [IoT](#iot)

## Wireless programmability

CMX location & CMX Presence (Connected Mobile Experiences). On-site there will be live instances that connected to Wi-Fi architecture of [UNIT Factory](https://unit.ua/en/) 

You can also use CMX or Meraki sandboxes to prepare and test your prototypes:
  - [CMX location](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/3f3178e9-8c8e-4b9a-9ced-689602d493cb?diagramType=Topology)
  - [Meraki Small Business](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/aa48e6e2-3e59-4b87-bfe5-7833c45f8db8?diagramType=Topology)
  
_Note that the Cisco technologies described below may be used for other challenges_
