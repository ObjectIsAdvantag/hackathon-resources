## Technologies / Mentors

Here are the technologies featured for the whole event, and related mentors:

- CiscoSpark (messaging, calls and meetings platform): Austin Hyland, John Higgins, Stève Sfartz (Cisco)
- Tropo (Phone communication API): Austin Hyland, John Higgins, Stève Sfartz (Cisco)
- Meraki (Wifi API): Rui Bras Fernandes, Stève Sfartz  (Cisco)


## Meraki Challenge

we'll give away one Meraki Access Points for each of the best prototypes built with the Meraki technology, and for up to a total value of 20 K€, 

The Meraki technology lets you build outstanding applications by interacting with the Wifi Network.

Typical use cases :
- detect presence from Mobile phones that have Wifi or Bluetooth activated,
- customize the landing page as users join your Wifi Network
- geo-locate your users via Wifi triangulation
 

## Cisco TechTalks

### An interactive Voice & Chat for the Pixel Camp event

Willing to be aware of your visitors journey in real-time ? 
Or interact with end-users by sending and answering calls & text messages automatically ? 
What about deploying custom code logic onto your network to analyse data close to your IoT devices ?  
Interested in deploying your own interactive assistant to request or take action into business back-end processes ? 
Here are a few possibilities offered by the Cisco REST APIs which can be freely accessed from DevNet - Cisco Developer Program.
 
We’ll first detail how to access DevNet resources, 
and then dig into the construction of an Interactive Voice and Chat assistant. 
In practice, we will drive you through Javascript source codes that leverage the Cisco Spark & Tropo REST APIs to answer the phone, 
read from external APIs, do real-time voice recognition, and send SMS in forked sessions. 

This session is for intermediate developers, with or without experience in Javascript, 
as all examples can be translated to other languages. 

Worth adding the Tropo APIs is free for developers, and supports not only Javascript but also PHP, Ruby, Groovy and Python.


### Who Says That a Crystal Ball Is The Only Way To Predict Cyber-Attacks?

Connecting the dots, being able to analyze a diverse set of information made of billions of pieces of discrete data allows to build the maps 
that reveal where the malicious infrastructure is hidden and where the attacks are staged. 

This turns the table of traditional security with a new approach where the defender takes the upper hand on the attacker, 
being able to pivot through the criminal infrastructure.
