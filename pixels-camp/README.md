## Meraki Challenge

we'll give away one Meraki Access Points for each of the best prototypes built with the Meraki technology, and for up to a total value of 20 K€, 

The Meraki technology lets you build outstanding applications by interacting with the Wifi Network.

Typical use cases :
- detect presence from Mobile phones that have Wifi or Bluetooth activated,
- customize the landing page as users join your Wifi Network
- geo-locate your users via Wifi triangulation
 

## Cisco TechTalk

**An interactive Voice & Chat for the Pixel Camp event**

Willing to be aware of your visitors journey in real-time ? 
Or interact with end-users by sending and answering calls & text messages automatically ? 
What about deploying custom code logic onto your network to analyse data close to your IoT devices ?  
Interested in deploying your own interactive assistant to request or take action into business back-end processes ? 
Here are a few possibilities offered by the Cisco REST APIs which can be freely accessed from DevNet - Cisco Developer Program.
 
We’ll first detail how to access DevNet resources, 
and then dig into the construction of an Interactive Voice and Chat assistant. 
In practice, we will drive you through Javascript source codes that leverage the Cisco Spark & Tropo REST APIs to answer the phone, 
read from external APIs, do real-time voice recognition, and send SMS in forked sessions. 

This session is for intermediate developers, with or without experience in Javascript, 
as all examples can be translated to other languages. 

Worth adding the Tropo APIs is free for developers, and supports not only Javascript but also PHP, Ruby, Groovy and Python.

Speakers: Stève Sfartz, Austin Hyland
